42,Seems like it would be very advantages if you graded your worst field for flooding giving it a 5% graded slope from each side to the middle with a 10% grade toward the drainage ditch and reseed for new grass in the Spring.  Gravity would drain the water to the middle and follow the 10% grade down to the drainage ditch.   Just a thought.  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,UgxhaR4bKXMQ8zs1lSF4AaABAg,0
