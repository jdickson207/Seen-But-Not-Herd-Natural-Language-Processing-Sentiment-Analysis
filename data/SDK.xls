Can't you have a static pumpsystem with equipment over manure level in a heated space and just drain back into lagoon when you stop pumping?  With stationary pressure pipes along sides in the lagoon with valves and nozzles under surface I can't see it as impossible to get everything out even in deep freeze times. If you can choose ratio between pumping out and for recirculation then it may solve most problems.  I don't really know your specific situation as I'm not used with sand bedding.  Low slanting bottom or pits in bottom of lagoon and suction pipes from there? Must be the same situation in the slurry pit at barn. (I'm a bit of a pumping nerd! :)",UgydJFLe-71cXka6igl4AaABAg,1

Took some guts to crawl into that pit!!! Drowning in the stuff would probably be my worst nightmare if I was there.

170,I would think a loop off of your pit pump onto a nozzle that could be turned 360 degrees would  be ideal to breakup the sand buildup in that pit - that way you dont need to open the lids and a valve setup could divert some manure to breakup and the rest out to the lagoon.,Ugzlp_HnI2EYyjQeEkp4AaABAg,0

174,bedding cow pack with sand is not a good idea bcuz it just thicker and gets hard wich makes it harder and much more work for you guys ............... u should try sawdust instead way much softer and easier .,UgztD9F3Q6ySQPLMsLV4AaABAg,0
