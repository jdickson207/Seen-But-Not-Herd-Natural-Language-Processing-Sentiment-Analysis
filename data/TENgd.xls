14,I wonder if the cows at the end of the barn know they‚Äôll get a few extra minutes of rest before you get down to them to clean the beds. They‚Äôve gotta learn from habit and I‚Äôd bet they have their own routine. I‚Äôd would be interesting to track a cow via gps or something to see what they do or which other cows they hang out with.,UgwQxsrxS9AhjCIGzxR4AaABAg,0
