It is very rewarding watching a new generation of diary, beef, and  grains/produce farmers and the dedication, knowledge, and love of being a farmer is all about.

Can't you have a static pumpsystem with equipment over manure level in a heated space and just drain back into lagoon when you stop pumping?  With stationary pressure pipes along sides in the lagoon with valves and nozzles under surface I can't see it as impossible to get everything out even in deep freeze times. If you can choose ratio between pumping out and for recirculation then it may solve most problems.  I don't really know your specific situation as I'm not used with sand bedding.  Low slanting bottom or pits in bottom of lagoon and suction pipes from there? Must be the same situation in the slurry pit at barn. (I'm a bit of a pumping nerd! :)\n",

Fire and Rescue here has had to recover 2 bodies this last year  after farmers were overcome by gasses from manure pits.  I know it might not seem bad at first when you go in ,  but you can die within minutes.   You have a great channel man,  but please be careful!\n",
